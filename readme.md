# Angular Starter

This is a starter app based on Todd Motto's styleguide. It uses:

* IIFE scoping
* Functions passed into module methods rather than assigned as callback
* `controllerAs` syntax
* One-time binding syntax

## Installation

    // Bower components
    $ bower install --save angular
    $ bower install --save angular-ui-router
    $ bower install --save angular-cookies
    $ bower install --save html5-boilerplate

## Todos

There are lots of todos here. It is meant to be a working project with many common
patterns implemented as modules, such as authentication/authorization, API communication,
socket.io integration, and more.
